# C-SDL1.2-Snake-Game
A snake game developed in C language using the graphic library SDL 1.2

This game was developed as an University project.
It is written in C language and using the SDL 1.2 graphic library.
The main feature to create this game was POINTERS, so there are a bunch of them hahahah.
There are two files. The user's manual and the Dev. documentation that explain everything.

*The game runs completely fine altough 
The hall of fame feature was not completely implemented. If you have any suggestions
or way to implement it.*

Feel free to suggestions and implementatios! XD
